Hi! My name is Eric Droegemeier and I am interested in data analytics. I am a graduate student at the University of North Texas. I am especially interested in sports analytics and how sports teams can use data-driven decision making to improve their on-field performance. In this portfolio I will showcase some projects I have done using R and various other data analytics software. I also plan on updating this portfolio with new projects I have made as I continue my degree.
